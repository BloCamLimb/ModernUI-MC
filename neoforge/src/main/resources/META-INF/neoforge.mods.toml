    Modern desktop framework from low-level 3D graphics API to high-level view model, for development of 2D/3D rendering software or game engine, with internationalization support and many new technologies.
    Modern UI is a desktop application framework designed for standalone 2D and 3D rendering software development. It makes use of modern 3D graphical APIs and technologies to provide high real-time rendering performance. For good measure, Modern UI improves and optimizes a set of features used by Android and its own set of internationalization supporting text layout engine meeting Unicode specification.
